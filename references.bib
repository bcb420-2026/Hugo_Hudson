	abstract = {Cardiomyopathy is currently the leading cause of death for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a severe neuromuscular disorder affecting young boys. Animal models have provided insight into the mechanisms by which dystrophin protein deficiency causes cardiomyopathy, but there remains a need to develop human models of DMD to validate pathogenic mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets. Here, we have developed human engineered heart tissues (EHTs) from CRISPR-edited, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) expressing a truncated dystrophin protein lacking part of the actin-binding domain. The 3D EHT platform enables direct measurement of contractile force, simultaneous monitoring of Ca

              transients, and assessment of myofibril structure. Dystrophin-mutant EHTs produced less contractile force as well as delayed kinetics of force generation and relaxation, as compared to isogenic controls. Contractile dysfunction was accompanied by reduced sarcomere length, increased resting cytosolic Ca

              levels, delayed Ca
              2+
              release and reuptake, and increased beat rate irregularity. Transcriptomic analysis revealed clear differences between dystrophin-deficient and control EHTs, including downregulation of genes related to Ca
              2+
              homeostasis and extracellular matrix organization, and upregulation of genes related to regulation of membrane potential, cardiac muscle development, and heart contraction. These findings indicate that the EHT platform provides the cues necessary to expose the clinically-relevant, functional phenotype of force production as well as mechanistic insights into the role of Ca

              handling and transcriptomic dysregulation in dystrophic cardiac function, ultimately providing a powerful platform for further studies in disease modeling and drug discovery.},

              Background
              Biologists need to perform complex queries, often across a variety of databases. Typically, each data resource provides an advanced query interface, each of which must be learnt by the biologist before they can begin to query them. Frequently, more than one data source is required and for high-throughput analysis, cutting and pasting results between websites is certainly very time consuming. Therefore, many groups rely on local bioinformatics support to process queries by accessing the resource's programmatic interfaces if they exist. This is not an efficient solution in terms of cost and time. Instead, it would be better if the biologist only had to learn one generic interface. BioMart provides such a solution.
            
            
              Results
              BioMart enables scientists to perform advanced querying of biological data sources through a single web interface. The power of the system comes from integrated querying of data sources regardless of their geographical locations. Once these queries have been defined, they may be automated with its "scripting at the click of a button" functionality. BioMart's capabilities are extended by integration with several widely used software packages such as BioConductor, DAS, Galaxy, Cytoscape, Taverna. In this paper, we describe all aspects of BioMart from a user's perspective and demonstrate how it can be used to solve real biological use cases such as SNP selection for candidate gene screening or annotation of microarray results.
            
            
              Conclusion
              
                BioMart is an easy to use, generic and scalable system and therefore, has become an integral part of large data resources including Ensembl, UniProt, HapMap, Wormbase, Gramene, Dictybase, PRIDE, MSD and Reactome. BioMart is freely accessible to use at

            Microarray technology has become a standard molecular biology tool. Experimental data have been generated on a huge number of organisms, tissue types, treatment conditions and disease states. The Gene Expression Omnibus (Barrett et al., 2005), developed by the National Center for Bioinformatics (NCBI) at the National Institutes of Health is a repository of nearly 140 000 gene expression experiments. The BioConductor project (Gentleman et al., 2004) is an open-source and open-development software project built in the R statistical programming environment (R Development core Team, 2005) for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data. The tools contained in the BioConductor project represent many state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of microarray and genomics data. We have developed a software tool that allows access to the wealth of information within GEO directly from BioConductor, eliminating many the formatting and parsing problems that have made such analyses labor-intensive in the past. The software, called GEOquery, effectively establishes a bridge between GEO and BioConductor. Easy access to GEO data from BioConductor will likely lead to new analyses of GEO data using novel and rigorous statistical and bioinformatic tools. Facilitating analyses and meta-analyses of microarray data will increase the efficiency with which biologically important conclusions can be drawn from published genomic data.
            Availability: GEOquery is available as part of the BioConductor project.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Summary: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.
