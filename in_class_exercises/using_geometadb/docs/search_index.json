Recent studies additionally imply an involvement of the wildtype protein in tumor progression, but the underlaying mechanism remains elusive. Here we report that SF3B1 acts as a coactivator for hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1α. SF3B1 directly interacts with HIF1a, augments HIF1a-HIF1b heterodimer binding to hypoxia response elements in vivo and enhances transactivation of HIF target genes. In human patients, primary patient cells and in a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), efficient HIF1a-signalling relies on SF3B1. Monoallelic deletion of Sf3b1 in this mouse tumor model severely delays tumor initiation and development and diminishes HIF target gene transcription, glucose uptake and proliferation in corresponding tumor organoids in hypoxia, while splicing remains functional. Here, we define a subset of aggressive chromophobe renal cell carcinomas (chRCCs) able to transcriptionally compensate monoallelic SF3B1 loss, a feature that correlates with poor prognosis and lymph node spread and we show that the oncogenic hotspot mutation SF3B1K700E has reduced co-activation efficiency. Also, we report increased sensitivity of cells with low levels of SF3B1 to the HIF-inhibitor PX-478. These findings reveal a splicing-independent, tumor promoting function of SF3B1, important in the pathogenesis of PDAC and other cancers. ## 2 Splicing factor 3b subunit 1 (SF3B1) is one of the most frequently mutated spliceosomal components in cancer.

These findings reveal a splicing-independent, tumor promoting function of SF3B1, important in the pathogenesis of PDAC and other cancers. ## title gpl source_name_ch1 characteristics_ch1 ## 1 A-1_Panc1_siCtrl_Nx GPL20301 PDAC cell line (ATCC) condition: Normoxia;\\ttreatment: siCtrl;\\tcell line: Panc1 ## 2 A-4_Panc1_siCtrl_Nx GPL20301 PDAC cell line (ATCC) condition: Normoxia;\\ttreatment: siCtrl;\\tcell line: Panc1 ## 3 A-2_Panc1_siCtrl_Hx GPL20301 PDAC cell line (ATCC) condition: Hypoxia;\\ttreatment: siCtrl;\\tcell line: Panc1 ## 4 A-5_Panc1_siCtrl_Hx GPL20301 PDAC cell line (ATCC) condition: Hypoxia;\\ttreatment: siCtrl;\\tcell line: Panc1 ## 5 A-8_Panc1_siCtrl_Hx GPL20301 PDAC cell line (ATCC) condition: Hypoxia;\\ttreatment: siCtrl;\\tcell line: Panc1 ## 6 A-3_Panc1_siSF3B1_Hx GPL20301 PDAC cell line (ATCC) condition: Hypoxia;\\ttreatment: siSF3B1;\\tcell line: Panc1 ## 7 A-6_Panc1_siSF3B1_Hx GPL20301 PDAC cell line (ATCC) condition: Hypoxia;\\ttreatment: siSF3B1;\\tcell line: Panc1 ## 8 A-9_Panc1_siSF3B1_Hx GPL20301 PDAC cell line (ATCC) condition: Hypoxia;\\ttreatment: siSF3B1;\\tcell line: Panc1 ## supplementary_file ## 1 ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE201nnn/GSE201427/suppl/GSE201427_CPM_RNA-Seq_Panc1.xlsx ## 2 ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE201nnn/GSE201427/suppl/GSE201427_CPM_RNA-Seq_Panc1.xlsx ## 3 ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE201nnn/GSE201427/suppl/GSE201427_CPM_RNA-Seq_Panc1.xlsx ## 4 ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE201nnn/GSE201427/suppl/GSE201427_CPM_RNA-Seq_Panc1.xlsx ## 5 ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE201nnn/GSE201427/suppl/GSE201427_CPM_RNA-Seq_Panc1.xlsx ## 6 ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE201nnn/GSE201427/suppl/GSE201427_CPM_RNA-Seq_Panc1.xlsx ## 7 ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE201nnn/GSE201427/suppl/GSE201427_CPM_RNA-Seq_Panc1.xlsx ## 8 ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE201nnn/GSE201427/suppl/GSE201427_CPM_RNA-Seq_Panc1.xlsx The GSE201427 study uses high throughoutput sequencing for expression profilling.

Since then the economical, health and human cost has been enormous for the world. However, little work has been done to understand the transcriptional changes brought about by the virus in human hosts. We have compared COVID-19 positive samples with negative samples from Indian patients to better understand the host response.. We find many genes related to immune response up-regulated in the COVID-19 patients. Many of these are the usual response genes against the viral infection but type I interferon appears to be a key immune response activated against SARS-CoV-2. A large number of the differentially expressed genes were down-regulated pointing towards translational arrest and down regulation of host mRNA during late infection. The down-regulated genes are well correlated with the clinical manifestations and symptoms due to SARS-CoV-2 infection such as the loss of smell and taste. We also find evidence of altered gene expression profiles associated with systemic complications such as neurological disturbances and high insulin requirement. Finally, we have identified many lncRNAs being down-regulated during COVID-19 infections. A few of these lncRNAs have functional role in viral infection. However, to understand the functional role of other lncRNAs, we looked at the function of their closest gene, since lncRNA are believed to have cis functionality. Our analysis suggests a role for lncRNA in down-regulation of metabolic and developmental processes during COVID-19 infection. ## 2 SARS-CoV-2 is a beta coronavirus causing COVID-19 which first emerged in Wuhan, China and was later declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.

Finally, we have identified many lncRNAs being down-regulated during COVID-19 infections. A few of these lncRNAs have functional role in viral infection. However, to understand the functional role of other lncRNAs, we looked at the function of their closest gene, since lncRNA are believed to have cis functionality. Our analysis suggests a role for lncRNA in down-regulation of metabolic and developmental processes during COVID-19 infection. ## 38 SARS-CoV-2 is a beta coronavirus causing COVID-19 which first emerged in Wuhan, China and was later declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Since then the economical, health and human cost has been enormous for the world. However, little work has been done to understand the transcriptional changes brought about by the virus in human hosts. We have compared COVID-19 positive samples with negative samples from Indian patients to better understand the host response.. We find many genes related to immune response up-regulated in the COVID-19 patients. Many of these are the usual response genes against the viral infection but type I interferon appears to be a key immune response activated against SARS-CoV-2. A large number of the differentially expressed genes were down-regulated pointing towards translational arrest and down regulation of host mRNA during late infection. The down-regulated genes are well correlated with the clinical manifestations and symptoms due to SARS-CoV-2 infection such as the loss of smell and taste.

Here we describe a human methylome atlas, based on deep whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of 39 cell types sorted from 205 healthy tissue samples. Replicates of the same cell type are &gt;99.5% identical, demonstrating robustness of cell identity programs to genetic variation and environmental perturbation. Unsupervised clustering of the atlas recapitulates key elements of tissue ontogeny, and identifies methylation patterns retained since gastrulation. Loci uniquely unmethylated in an individual cell type often reside in transcriptional enhancers and contain DNA binding sites for tissue-specific transcriptional regulators. Uniquely methylated loci are rare and are enriched for CpG islands, polycomb targets, and CTCF binding sites, suggesting a role in shaping cell type-specific chromatin looping. The atlas provides an essential resource for interpretation of disease-associated genetic variants, and a wealth of potential tissue-specific biomarkers for use in liquid biopsies. ## 2 DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic mark that governs chromatin organization, cell identity, and gene expression.

Unsupervised clustering of the atlas recapitulates key elements of tissue ontogeny, and identifies methylation patterns retained since gastrulation. Loci uniquely unmethylated in an individual cell type often reside in transcriptional enhancers and contain DNA binding sites for tissue-specific transcriptional regulators. Uniquely methylated loci are rare and are enriched for CpG islands, polycomb targets, and CTCF binding sites, suggesting a role in shaping cell type-specific chromatin looping. The atlas provides an essential resource for interpretation of disease-associated genetic variants, and a wealth of potential tissue-specific biomarkers for use in liquid biopsies. ## 86 DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic mark that governs chromatin organization, cell identity, and gene expression.

[ reached &#39;max&#39; / getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 163 rows ] The GSE186458 study is high throughput sequencing of methylation profiles. Specifically looking at DNA methylation patterns in adults with the use of deep whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. It is not using a disease, the study models the human methylome to gain a better understanding of regulatory elements within specific cell types. There are 253 samples in this study with bed files containing the methylation signal provided per sample. There is not a distinction between control and disease in this study, only in tissue-region as samples are collected throughout the body for example aorta and lung tissues.
